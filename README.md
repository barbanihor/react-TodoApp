# Todo App

A simple Todo application built using React. The app allows users to manage a list of tasks, mark them as completed, filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed), and delete or edit existing tasks. It integrates with an API to persist data and provides feedback on actions through error messages and loading indicators.
